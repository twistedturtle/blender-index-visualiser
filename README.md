# Index Visualiser
Show the indices of mesh components in a readable manner. Works with verts, edges and faces.

The selection mode determines which indices are displayed. The other controls are found in the Overlay menu when in EDIT mode, under the Dev header.

Two keyboard shortcuts are defined by default.

F5 - Reload scripts* <br>
F6 - Toggles display of index labels

*If you reload scripts normally then you'll lose the reference to the draw callback should it be running. This means you won't be able to turn it off.
